        <h1>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight bold">Gabriel</span>,<br>
        a Full Stack Software Engineer</h1>
        <p>Let's find out how I can turn your ideas into code.</p>
        <!-- Story blurb -->
        <p>I've always had a passion for computers growing up. My first real job was as an accountant for a local bakery, I realized then how big of an impact my passion had on me when my job turned into solving computer related issues instead of accounting ones. Eventually, I was tasked with maintaining our company website. This is when I discovered and fell in love with HTML, CSS, JS and Node.  I found myself spending more time coding and solving problems even when I was at home. After the pandemic hit, I decided to transition fields fully and started working as a freelancing software engineer for my local community. My mission now is to help my community grow by helping them develop easily accessible websites that represent them and their values.</p>

            <h3>Twisted Scissors Salon</h3>
            <p>Twisted Scissors Salon came to me wanting their website to represent them as a company. One that would show their elegence and care to their customers. We worked with them to achieve a website that satisfied their needs and helped them grow their clientelle.</p>

            <h3>Pellicano Pasta</h3>
            <p>Pellicano Pasta told me that customers main complaint was their inability to find a menu online. Many resturants don't realise just how many people are looking for accessible menu to their restuarant. We agreed on design together which priotized this need and incorporated visual aide to intrigued the customer.</p>

            <p>This was a really fun project, it was a silly idea from a colleague, "what if we could somehow create a symphony but instead of using instruments we used animals?"</p>
