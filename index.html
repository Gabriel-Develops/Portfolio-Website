        <h1>Hello! I'm <span class="highlight bold">Gabriel</span>,<br>
        a Full Stack Software Engineer</h1>
        <p>Let's find out how I can turn your ideas into code.</p>
        <!-- Story blurb -->
        <p>I've always had a passion for computers growing up. My first real job was as an accountant for a local bakery, I realized then how big of an impact my passion had on me when my job turned into solving computer related issues instead of accounting ones. Eventually, I was tasked with maintaining our company website. This is when I discovered and fell in love with HTML, CSS, JS and Node.  I found myself spending more time coding and solving problems even when I was at home. After the pandemic hit, I decided to transition fields fully and started working as a freelancing software engineer for my local community. My mission now is to help my community grow by helping them develop easily accessible websites that represent them and their values.</p>
